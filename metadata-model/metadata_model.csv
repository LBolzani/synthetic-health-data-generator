Data type,Dataset,A placeholder concept for visual navigation by dividing data formats by the content of the data that is represented.,M,"Tabular, digitized image",EDAM,format:2350,if not in EDAM then EFO
Operation,Dataset,"A function that processes a set of inputs and results in a set of outputs, or associates arguments (inputs) with values (outputs).",M,"Prediction of malignancy, Virulence prediction",EDAM,operation:0004,"Changed to ""Operation"", but perhaps it's too generic for the original intended use of ""what you will apply this process to"", instead of ""apply the data for"". Ask to add ML into STATO to Philippe."
License,Dataset,A legal document giving official permission to do something with the resource.,M,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,DUO,http://purl.org/dc/terms/license,
Generation method,Tool,A planned process that produces output data from input data.,M,sampling from a probability distribution,STATO,OBI:0200000,Ask to add ML into STATO to Philippe
Author ORCID,Attribution,A standard alphanumeric code to uniquely identify scientific and other academic authors and contributors.,M,0000-0002-7747-6255,REPR,ORCID,"Used REPR:ORCID because EDAM's ""data:1881"" is not specifically an ORCID, but could be used as its parental term, or request its addition to EDAM."
DOI ,Dataset,Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of a published article.,S,10.4103/0019-509x.200658,EDAM,data:1188,An identifier (not necessarily DOI) is a Must/Minimal property for Bioschemas
Dataset name,Dataset,"The name of the dataset, which need not necessarily uniquely identify it.",S,Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set,,,The name of the dataset is a Must/Minimal property for Bioschemas
Dataset description,Dataset,The description of the dataset,S,Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant,,,The description of the dataset is a Must/Minimal property for Bioschemas
Publication year,Dataset,The year in which a document was published,S,2022,NCIT,NCIT:C183340,
Organism taxonomic identifier,Dataset,Taxonomy identifier curated by the NCBI Taxonomy (search for organism IDs here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy; or use the OLS: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ncbitaxon). You can find further details at 'https://www.uniprot.org/help/taxonomic_identifier'.,S,9606,NCBITaxon,NCIT:C164641,
Organism common name,Dataset,"Common name (e.g. 'human') used to designate a plant, animal or other organism, as opposed to the scientific name.",S,Human,,,
biological sex,Dataset,An organismal quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the bearer's ability to undergo sexual reproduction in order to differentiate the individuals or types involved.,S,Female,PATO,PATO:0000047,
Sample size,Dataset,statistical sample size is a count evaluating the number of individual experimental units,S,10.000,STATO,STATO:0000088,
Experimental unit,Dataset,the role played by an entity part of study group as defined by an experimental design and realized in a data analysis and data interpretation,S,"Patients, physical samples, tissue cultures, cell nuclei, blood samples, cells, temperature measurements…",STATO,STATO:0000162,"Perhaps it would be interesting to have an extra field just to count the patient group size, which may be a big cut-off for many researchers filtering datasets. Also removed 'Instance type' and replaced it with this property."
Number of attributes,Dataset,"Number of sample's information carriers that can be measured, observed, or logged.",S,32,OBO,,EFO
File type (format),Dataset,The main format in which data is structured and represented in an electronic file. It is normally defined by the file extension of the file (e.g. FASTQ for a '.fastq' file).,S,"CSV, HTML, FASTQ, FASTA, CRAM, VCF, PNG…",EDAM,format:1915,"Didn't use the official description of ""format"" from EDAM, since I would rather have users tell us the ""main"" format (e.g. if a VCF file is compressed or encrypted its format may be GZIP, but I would rather be interested in it being a VCF file than a GZIP)."
Paper ID ,Dataset,,C,NA,,,What is the difference between the DOI above and the paper ID? 
Tool/Code resource identifier,Tool,"Unique and persistent identifier of an external resource where the tool (its documentation or code) is hosted. It should be uniquely resolvable (e.g. either be a URI, or a Compact URI resolvable against identifiers.org). ",C,github:elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2022; https://www.kaggle.com/code/berkemk/breast-cancer-prediction-svc,,,"Wanted something more specific than ""Tool ID"", specially when giving URIs, but perhaps I went overkill. Feel free to modify. "
Language,Dataset,Structured system of communication in which the dataset is defined,C,English,,,
Assay instrument,Provenance,The general categories (e.g. Single Cell Sequencing) of the used assay instrument to generate the original data.,C,"Array, Mass spectrometry, Sequencer",EFO,EFO:0002773,
Assay instrument platform,Provenance,Platform's label of the used assay.,C,"Affymetrix, Illumina HiSeq 2500, [HT_Rat-Focus] Affymetrix HT Rat Focus Array, MinION",,,"I see this as a free text field, since the platforms are too heterogeneous. We could perhaps use also a reference to the platform, instead of the label (e.g. 'geo:GPL6855' for 'Whole genome Leishmania spp. 9k microarray v1.0', resolvable through identifiers.org)"
Attribute type,Dataset,,C,Mixed: numerical and categorical,OBO,,"Is this ""attribute types"" field suppose to contain all types of attributes? Like TAGs (e.g. numerical, categorical…)?"
Number of missing values,Dataset,,C,None,OBO,,"Is this field specified per attribute (e.g. 10 in attribute A, 20 attribute B…)? All ttogether (e.g. 30 in total)? Just the categories with missing values (e.g. attribute A and attribute B)?"
